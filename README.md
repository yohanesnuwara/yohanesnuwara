About Me

üëã Hi, my name is Yohanes Nuwara. In the meantime, I am working as a reservoir geophysicist. I have B.Sc in Geophysics (2019). I solved problems in Oil and Gas using Python as my main programming language. I am deeply interested in the application of Python to numerical computation for reservoir studies, modeling, and simulation for engineering. I am also interested in machine learning for oil and gas application.
