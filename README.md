## Hi There!

I'm Yohanes Nuwara. I'm currently a research engineer on DAS fiber-optic sensing at the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) in Kyoto, Japan.

About Me

👋 Hi, my name is Yohanes Nuwara. In the meantime, I am working as a reservoir geophysicist. I have B.Sc in Geophysics (2019). I solved problems in Oil and Gas using Python as my main programming language. I am deeply interested in the application of Python to numerical computation for reservoir studies, modeling, and simulation for engineering. I am also interested in machine learning for oil and gas application.
