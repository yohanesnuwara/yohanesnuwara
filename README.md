## Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

I'm Yohanes Nuwara. I'm a reservoir geophysicist, who loves to mix geoscience with data science and machine learning. I have been teaching Python to 1,000+ students and professionals in the exploration and production domain. This is my showcase. If you would like to collaborate, kindly [contact me](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/yohanesnuwara#-contact-me) if you wish!

About Me

👋 Hi, my name is Yohanes Nuwara. In the meantime, I am working as a reservoir geophysicist. I have B.Sc in Geophysics (2019). I solved problems in Oil and Gas using Python as my main programming language. I am deeply interested in the application of Python to numerical computation for reservoir studies, modeling, and simulation for engineering. I am also interested in machine learning for oil and gas application.
